# Partial Sum of Fibonacci Numbers
#
# Given two non-negative integers m and n, where m â‰¤ n, find the last digit of the sum 
# F(m) + F(m+1) + ... + F(n-1) + F(n).
#
# The idea is to find a representation for the serie S(m,n) = F(m) + F(m+1) + ... + F(n-1) + F(n).
# To achieve that, each Fibonacci number can be represented as follows:
# 
# F(n+1) = F(n)   + F(n-1) => F(n-1) = F(n+1) - F(n)
# F(n)   = F(n-1) + F(n-2) => F(n-2) = F(n)   - F(n-1)
# F(n-1) = F(n-2) + F(n-3) => F(n-3) = F(n-1) - F(n-2)
#  ...          ...                     ...
# F(m+3) = F(m+2) + F(m+1) => F(m+1) = F(m+3) - F(m+2)
# F(m+2) = F(m+1) + F(m)   => F(m)   = F(m+2) - F(m+1)
#
# Now, F(n-1) + F(n-2) + ... + F(m+1) + F(m) = F(n+1) - F(m+1) = S(m,n-1)
# Then, for n, the serie is S(n) = F(n+2) - F(m+1)
#
# Input:    two integers n and m; 0 <= m <= n <= 10^18
# Output:   last digit of F(m) + F(m+1) + ... + F(n).

# Fast solution to get the last digit for a huge Fibonacci number. To achieve that, it was
